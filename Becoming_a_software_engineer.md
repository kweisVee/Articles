# Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer: Navigating Challenges and Staying Consistent

Embarking on a career as a software engineer can be a daunting journey, especially when faced with challenges such as imposter syndrome and limited experience. In this article, we'll explore the story of one individual's pursuit of landing a job as a software engineer, highlighting the strategies, experiences, and lessons learned along the way. Through consistent efforts, determination, and a passion for continuous learning, this individual overcame obstacles to fulfill their aspirations.

The journey began as a student in the Philippines, where the individual grappled with the desire to break into the competitive field of software engineering in the United States. Despite harboring imposter syndrome and comparing themselves to peers, they recognized the importance of self-awareness and channeled it into working harder than ever before.

While good grades can play a role in securing a first job, other factors like experience and projects are equally important. Utilizing school breaks, the individual embarked on creating projects with diverse languages and stacks, ranging from Django to MERN and Java. By incorporating personal interests such as Twitter, restaurants, and films, they honed their skills and demonstrated their passion through practical applications.

To strengthen their knowledge of logic and algorithms, the individual turned to platforms like LeetCode, particularly leveraging the resources offered by neetcode.io/practice. By committing to solving at least two problems daily and gradually increasing the count, they built problem-solving skills and perseverance. Focusing on one data structure at a time allowed them to understand patterns and refine their problem-solving abilities. Moreover, tackling LeetCode problems in Java, a strongly typed language, enhanced their understanding of variable types and data structures.

Mock Interviews and Behavioral Preparation:
Although initially hesitant, the individual recognized the value of mock interviews in preparing for the technical aspects of job interviews. While actual mock interviews were challenging due to shyness, they found solace in watching mock interviews on platforms like YouTube. By observing how interviewees answered technical questions and articulated their thought processes, they gained insights and improved their interview readiness. Additionally, they emphasized the significance of preparing for behavioral questions, as they play an equally important role in the interview process. Familiarizing oneself with common behavioral questions and providing authentic answers aligned with their personality can make a significant impact.

Persistence and a proactive approach to job applications proved crucial. Utilizing LinkedIn and challenging themselves to apply to at least 10 positions daily, the individual maximized their chances of success. While carefully reading job descriptions is essential, sometimes taking a leap of faith without fully meeting the stated criteria can lead to unexpected opportunities. Their own experience, securing a position despite applying to one that required seven years of experience, exemplifies the unpredictable nature of the job search. Through perseverance, they sent nearly 200 applications, faced two interviews, and ultimately received one offer.

Becoming a successful software engineer requires consistent efforts, an unwavering curiosity, and a commitment to continuous learning. By overcoming challenges, embracing self-awareness, working on projects, honing problem-solving skills, preparing for interviews, and persistently applying to opportunities, the individual in this story managed to land a job in their desired field. Their journey serves as a reminder to aspiring software engineers to remain dedicated, curious, and resilient on their own path, ultimately leading them to where they are meant to be.
