# What is the useEffect Hook in React.js?

Hooks are very important once coding with React.js.

### PLace why they are important here

### Place the most common react hooks

One of the things that I find most useful though is the useEffect() hook. This hook is used to perform some side effects in functional components and is triggered depending on its arguments - which is its callback function as well as its dependency array, which is optional as you can fill it up or leave it blank.

### Place why the useEffect is important

For example:

`Place code`

Since useEffect() is a hook, it is always best to place it on top of your component.
